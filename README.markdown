# Beef Sinatra

Beef Sinatra is a blank [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app, with a few basic settings created so we don't have to repeat some tasks every time we want to set up a new app. Based on [sinatra-sprockets](https://github.com/jch/sinatra-sprockets) by [Jerry Cheung](http://whatcodecraves.com/).
